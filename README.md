And so this was made.

The blockstate file for this block is stupidly large (1.08 GB) and cannot be generated using Minecraft's datagen system. You must generate it using this C++ project: https://github.com/hiisuuii/comically-large-blockstate-datagen or get it from that repo's releases page.

You will also need to allocate at LEAST 64 gigs of RAM to Minecraft when running this. I honestly have no idea how much it will need but it's probably upwards of 100 GB.
